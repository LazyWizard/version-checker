    # Points toward the online master .version file. This mod works by comparing
    # the local and online version to see if there is a newer version available.
    #
    # The master file must be:
    # - Online (duh)
    # - Directly reachable (the URL goes to the raw file, not a redirect page)
    # - Permanently linked and editable without the URL itself changing
    #
    # Bitbucket, GitHub, and other online repositories make excellent hosts.
    # If you have a Dropbox account that's a few years old, that will also work.
    # Just make sure it is in your Public folder and that you get the URL by
    # right-clicking and selecting "Copy public link". Free Dropbox accounts
    # created after October 2012 will not have a Public folder, unfortunately.
    #
